what is recursion - recursion is when a function is called within itself to solve a probelm. 

A base case - simply helps stop the recusion from infinitly continuing. if you want it to continue you can use recursive Case  

A recursive step is you making a call to the function with modified arguments 

stack overflow is almost how it sounds, but it keeps tracks of functionn calls and variables,  when there is an infinite recursion  preventing unexpected crashes and errors. 

event loop tends to asynchronous operations and codeing execution. 

a call stack tracks function calls and local variables. 


now the measseg queue is a list of messages to be processed. each message has an associated function that gets called to handle the message. 


Asynchronous is where operations are run independtly while the program continues to run while waiting on tasks to be completed. 

now Synchronous is where task of a progam are executed one at a time. 


IIFE which stands for (Immediately Invoked Funtion Expression)
it is desgined to have a funciton defined and exectuted immedietly making things more faster and effient. IIFE is useful when running initialization code by execute set-up task immeditley. you can also run functions immeditely without requiring external calls.
